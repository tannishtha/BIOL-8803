The output.vcf file contains the SNPs in the BAM file (created by sorting from the two input files) with the reference genome of chromosome 17.
The columns give the various description of the SNPs :
First column : chromosome number
Second column: Postion of the SNP in the genome
Third column : ID
Fourth column : Base in the reference genome
Fifth Column : Base in the sorted BAM file 
Sixth column : Filter
Seventh column : Information regarding the SNP like raw read depth, segregation based metric, total number of alleles, average mapping quality etc.
Eighth column : format in genotype in Phred scale 


The file was generated by using various tools in the following order : 
1.bwa which indexed the reference file and mapped the reads to the reference
2.samtools created a sorted BAM file
3.GenomeAnalysis.jar from GTAK did realignment of the BAM file after indexing the reference file and also creating a dictionary for it (both by samtools) and indexing the sorted SAM file
4.samtools indexed the BAM file obtained from realignment
5.Variant calling by samtools mpileup and bcftools call with the indexed BAM file from the previous step and reference genome
